RentIt’s domain model describes how the rental platform works behind the scenes. There is a main User account, and it can act as a Host (someone who lists items) or a Renter (someone who books items). Hosts create Listings, and each listing can be either a PropertyListing (like an apartment/house) or an EquipmentListing (like a bike, car, or tools). Every listing has AvailabilitySlots to show which dates are open or blocked. Renters make a Booking for a specific listing by choosing start and end dates, and the booking stores the total amount and its current status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, etc.). A booking can also have an optional Payment record to simulate paying in the prototype. After the rental is completed, the renter can leave a Review with a rating and comment about the listing (and the host). This model covers the full flow from listing an item to booking, paying, and reviewing.
